## Installation
No installation needed, just a web browser. If you are working using node.js, see below  

```bash
npm install express
```  
Also added an npm package to generate a unique id  

```bash
npm install uuid
```

## Usage
Please make sure that you install No commands and then you can 
There is an initial webpage that appears and that button that is available will take you to the note taking web page. Your notes will be saved on a database so it can retrieve any previous notes that were taken.

## Credits
Credit to whoever made the initial files to use and help bring everything together.

## Future
Will be adding a delete function later.
